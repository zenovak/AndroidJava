## Example Projects 🗿

Google has abandoned Java in-favor of Kotlin and Jetpack compose to build Android UI applications, while Java is still technically supported,
there's isnt any official step by step guide on how to get started with the Views way of creating UI (I couldnt find any), so 
This created a problem where: 
- Dont know how legacy app UI works
- Cant maintain older apps
- Cant get android developer job

There arent' many resources out there that shows essential step by step implementation of features, jetpack libs and UI in the old gold standard
This is it.
- ✔️ Java + Views Layout
- ❌ Kotlin + Jetpack Compose

### Why dont use kotlin
Personal preference for C-like language styles.

### Why dont use compose
Personal preference for older XML style UI over React-like functional components style UI
