## Kobayashi's Example Projects 🗿

Google has abandoned Java in-favor of Kotlin and Jetpack compose to build Android UI applications, while Java is still technically supported,
there's isnt any official step by step guide on how to get started with the Views way of creating UI (I couldnt find any), so 
This created a problem where: 
- Dont know how imperative app UI works
- Cant maintain older apps
- Cant get android developer job

There arent' many resources out there that shows essential step by step implementation of features, how to use jetpack libs and XML UI in the old gold standard.
This is it.
- ✔️ Java + Views Layout
- ❌ Kotlin + Jetpack Compose

The importance of learning the imperative way of building the UI than just use compose is the web dev's equivalent of:
> Learn Javascript, HTML and CSS before you jump and learn React. Have strong understanding of fundamentals before learning a framework.
